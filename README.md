# Pact Testing with Java

This repository demonstates how to set up [PACT testing](https://docs.pact.io/) using Java. 

## Prerequisites

This repository comes with a pre-configured 
[Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), containing all the necessary tools and 
dependencies needed to develop and run the PACT tests.

If you don't wish to use the Dev Container, you can set up the environment manually. The following tools are required:
- Java 21 or higher

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three main directories:
- `consumer`: This directory contains the consumer code and tests. The consumer is the service that makes requests to 
  the provider.
- `provider`: This directory contains the provider code and tests. The provider is the service that receives requests
  from the consumer.
- `pact`: This directory contains the PACT files. These files are used to verify the interactions between the consumer
  and provider. The PACT files are generated by the consumer tests and are used by the provider tests to verify the 
  interactions.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following commands:
- `./gradlew :consumer:clean :consumer:test` to run the consumer tests and generate the PACT files.
- `./gradlew :provider:clean :provider:test` to run the provider tests and verify the interactions using the PACT files.
